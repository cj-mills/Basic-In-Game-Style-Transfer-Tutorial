# Basic In-Game Style Transfer Tutorial - Outdated ([Latest](https://github.com/cj-mills/End-to-End-In-Game-Style-Transfer-Tutorial))

**Important:** This repository contains an early prototype for my in-game style transfer project and should not be used. Use [this project](https://github.com/cj-mills/End-to-End-In-Game-Style-Transfer-Tutorial) instead.

This project uses models trained with this [`fast_neural_style`](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) implementation to apply in-game style transfer to the [Kinematica_Demo](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Kinematica_Demo/) project provided by Unity.

**Note:** Complete the following steps before running the project for the first time.
1. Open the Kinematica folder in the Assets section. 
2. Double-click on the `Unit` asset.
3. Click `Build` in the pop-up window. 
4. Close the pop-up window once the build is complete.
5. Back in the `Assets` section, open the `Biped` scene in the `Scenes` folder.

The project should run normally now. However, there might be some stuttering the first time it is run.
